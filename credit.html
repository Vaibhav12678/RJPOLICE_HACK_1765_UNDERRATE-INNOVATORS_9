    <h1>Online Debit card/Credit card related fraud</h1>
    <p> If you are concerned about online debit card or credit card fraud, it's crucial to prioritize your personal security and take preventative measures. Here are some tips:
     <br>
        <b>Secure Personal Information:</b>
        <br>
        Never share your debit card or credit card details, including the card number, expiration date, CVV, and PIN, with anyone you don't trust explicitly.
        <br>
       <b> Use Secure Websites:</b>
        <br>
        When making online purchases, ensure that the website is secure. Look for "https://" in the URL and check for a padlock symbol in the address bar.
        <br>
        <b>Monitor Your Accounts:</b>
        <br>
        Regularly monitor your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. If you notice anything suspicious, report it to your bank immediately.
        <br>
       <b> Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</b>
        <br>
        Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security.
        <br>
        <b>Keep Software Updated:</b>
        <br>
        Keep your computer, mobile devices, and antivirus software up to date to protect against potential security vulnerabilities.
        <br>
        <b>Be Wary of Phishing Attempts:</b>
        <br>
        Be cautious of emails, messages, or websites that ask for your personal or financial information. Legitimate organizations will not request such information via email or text.
        <br>
        <b>Use Strong Passwords:</b>
        <br>
        Create strong and unique passwords for your online accounts. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words.
        <br>
       <b> Report Lost or Stolen Cards Immediately:</b>
        <br>
        If your debit card or credit card is lost or stolen, report it to your bank or card issuer immediately. They can deactivate the card to prevent unauthorized use.
        <br>
       <b> Educate Yourself:</b>
        <br>
        Stay informed about common online scams and fraud tactics. Awareness is key to avoiding falling victim to fraudulent activities.
